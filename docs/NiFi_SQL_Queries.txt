SQL Queries Used:

  For segregating the table into 3 different tables:
  
  #customer_info --> select "Customer ID","First Name","Last Name","Email Address","Phone Number","Shipping Address","VIP Status"
                     from FLOWFILE
  
  #order_info --> select "Customer ID","Order ID","Order Date","Product ID","Total Purchase Value"
                  from FLOWFILE 

  #payment_and_delivery_info --> select "Customer ID","Order ID","Total Purchase Value","Payment Info","Delivery Status","Delivery Address"
                                 from FLOWFILE


  For creating a new column in payment_and_delivery_info and assign its value from pre-existing column "Total Purchase Value":

  SELECT *, 
  CASE 
    WHEN "Total Purchase Value" < 500 THEN 'Wireless Mouse'
    WHEN "Total Purchase Value" <= 1200 THEN 'Bluetooth Headphones'
    ELSE 'Keyboard + Wireless Mouse'
  END AS "Gift Won"
  FROM FLOWFILE
